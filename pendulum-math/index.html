        Below is a realtime simulation of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_pendulum">double pendulum</a> with point masses and no friction. I derived the differential equations of the double pendulum from scratch with sympy. The simulation uses the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods">Rungeâ€“Kutta method</a> to integrate the differential equations at each time step.

        The code is here: <a href="https://github.com/robz/pendulum_math">https://github.com/robz/pendulum_math</a>

        My goal with this project was to use the double pendulum as a case study for understanding how to simulate arbitrary physical systems, eventually to play around with different control algorithms. I was inspired by the acrobot, a robot problem that I learned about in <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/underactuated-robotics-mitx-6-832x-0">MIT's Underactuated Robotics course</a>.
