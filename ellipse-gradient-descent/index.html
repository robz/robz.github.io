    <div style="width: 500px; margin: auto">
      <p>Click and drag on the plots below to draw a curve. A gradient descent optimizer will then attempt to find an ellipse that best fits the curve. The plot that incorporates phase usually fits the curve better.</p>
      <h2>Details</h2>
      <p>Gradient descent works by attempting to minimize the "error" between the hand-drawn curve and the ellipse, which is computed by summing over the euclidean distances between points on the ellipse and each corresponding point on the hand-drawn curve:</p>
      <code>
        sum(i = 0..N, euclid(ellipse(2 * pi * i / N), handdrawn(i)))
      </code>
      <p>The two plots use two different models of an ellipse. The first is modeled with four configurable parameters a, b, x0, and y0:</p>
      <code>(x0 + a * cos(t), y0 + b * sin(t))</code>
      <p>This model works ok, but the point where t=0 is always at the 3'oclock position, as shown by the small circle. That prevents the error sum above from ever converging to zero  if you draw a loop that doesn't start from the 3 o'clock position.</p>
      <p>For example, if you draw a loop starting somewhere on the x axis, and then circle around the origin, then this model would could fit the drawn curve pretty well. But if you draw a loop starting somewhere on the y-axis instead, then the model would be unable to fit it very well. This is because at t=0, the model always has y=y0.</p>
      <p>To address this issue, the second model adds a fifth "phase" parameter:</p>
      <code>(x0 + a * cos(t + phase), y0 + b * sin(t + phase))</code>
      <p>The phase parameter effectively allows the ellipse to rotate. That way, it can fit any hand-drawn ellipse curve regardlesss of where the drawing started. The small circle is the point on the ellipse where t=0, and is usually close to the first point on the hand-drawn ellipse.</p>
